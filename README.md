PA3 Starter Code
PA: Sorting
Description: This PA implements various sorting algorithms that are aided by the
use of various comparator classes that we implemented.
Features: We have 5 comparator files and 4 different sorting algorithms
implemented in this PA. We also had 2 interfaces that had default methods (swap
and print, for our sorting files),called Sorting.java and Comparator.java.

Acknowledges: The lab hours and lectures helped greatly on this PA. Learning
about the various sorting algorithms was also a huge help.
